"""What a stored run remembers decides what empanelment can ever disprove.

An artifact that drops the commands a run issued does not merely lose detail -
it makes every command-aware rule unfalsifiable, because the check abstains and
the abstention reads as silence. These assert the record is complete enough to
contradict a rule, and that an older, thinner record admits it is thin rather
than pretending nothing happened.
