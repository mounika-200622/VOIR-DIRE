"""The clerk, drawn as data.

No asset is traced or downloaded: every pixel is placed here, so the sprite
sheet is versionable, diffable, and regenerates at any scale. Run

    python -m voiddire.art.clerk

to write web/sprites/clerk.png, clerk@4x.png and clerk.json.

The character is a records clerk with a cathode-ray tube where a face would be.
It never emotes. The screen displays the record - a rule count, a holding
number, a verdict - which is the only reason a mascot is allowed here at all.

# A shadow is not the same colour turned down. Light that reaches a surface
# directly is the lamp's, which is yellow-leaning; light that reaches a surface
# in shadow is bounced and ambient, which is blue-leaning. So a shade rotates
# hue toward violet and a highlight rotates it toward yellow, and saturation
# moves the other way in each case - shadows hold their colour, highlights wash
# out. Doing this by arithmetic rather than by eye keeps every material on the
# sprite consistent with every other one.

#   highlight  hue +11 deg (warm) / -11 (cool),  sat -18%,  value x1.09
#   occlusion  where two forms meet: the shade, halved again
#
# Directions flip on cool hues because "toward violet" is a different way round
# the wheel from orange than it is from green.
